I sometimes want to take pictures with a remote control, and leave the mobile on the table, standing upright. So, made a tiny stand with 0 deg and 15 deg angles.

If you use the stand for watching videos, the other designs with a 30 degree tilt might be better.

Just added another variation: if you prefer 15 deg and 30 deg instead.

This is a VESA-compatible stand that comes with LED lights. It incorporates a 4-bar linkage design for the tilt mechanism that can support monitors of most weights and sizes.

Maximum height 11 in (though you can just scale the z height and make it taller)
Can be used for portrait mode if your monitor is 23 in or smaller. (Less than 21 inches in width)
Tilt about +- 5 degrees
Angle +- 40 degrees
safe loading: 20lb

The stand is part of a bigger monitor arm project that I started in the summer of 2021. My goal is to 3D print a fully functional ergonomic monitor arm. If you want to follow along, make sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel and check out other builds.

Print settings:

We used PLA in testing but I would recommend using ABS or ASA especially if the ambient temperature in your environment is above 25C. This is highly important because PLA will creep and deform over time if the room temperature is too warm or the load is too high.

15-18 % gyroid infill
4 Walls
0.15 layer height
Support as needed
Orientation is highly important to see one of the images.

Parts list:
4 Â¼ in screw 3 in length

1 kg roll of filament
4 days of print time
